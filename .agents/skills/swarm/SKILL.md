# Swarm

Fan out N parallel workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todo list with one entry per phase before launching anything — the harness's task-list tool when it has one, a checklist you keep in your replies otherwise.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not the runtime's concurrency limit.
4. Pick the worker model. Use the environment's swarm-worker roster if it defines one, otherwise the fastest model that can still do the work — swarm workers are throughput-bound, not judgment-bound. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. Use a worktree, branch, or `/tmp/swarm-<slug>/worker-<n>/`.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message using the available parallel delegation capability: general-purpose sub-agents, backgrounded so they run concurrently, on the model chosen in Phase A.

If the runtime cannot delegate in parallel, say so and drop N to what you can run sequentially rather than pretending to fan out.

When a worker must start from a branch other than the default, name that branch in its brief and pass it through whichever base-branch option the runtime exposes.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
